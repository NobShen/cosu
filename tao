The Tao is constant.
And one who seeks the Tao unlearns something new every day, according to Lao Tzu.
So instead of limiting ourselves to a belief system, we let go, keep an open mind, and give the universe room to show itself as it is.
Trying to change nature is a futile pursuit, as is trying to blur our vision of nature by man-made constructs.
Instead of adding to knowledge, we let go of knowledge, until we reach a point of inner stillness.
Only then, we’re opening ourselves up to the Tao, or what we, from a theistic point of view, could call God.
In this state of emptiness, we feel content.
And contentment is true happiness.
The Taoists call this process the fasting of the heart.
By unlearning something every day, the Taoist arrives at non-action.
It’s the art of not trying, while nothing will be left undone.
