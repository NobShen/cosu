The Zhuangzi tells us a story about animals and the wind that envy each other for their inborn characteristics.
The centipede envies the snake for the fact that it can move without legs, but the snake envies the wind for its ability to travel great distances without having a body at all.
However, the wind argues that it takes just a finger or foot to hinder it.
All in all, nature has created everything with its own attributes.
Nothing is better than the other; only judgment makes it so.
Thus, we feel the need to change who we are, just to fit an ideal.
White-skinned people try to be tanned, while East-Asians try to look more European, brunettes try to be blondes, and blondes try to be brunettes.
Also, we try to change ourselves because we want to conform to a manmade standard; to fit in, simply because we’re seen as defects when we don’t.
So, a sixth’ finger is cut off, just to comply with the five-finger standard.
Why can’t we just be who we are, the way nature intended us to be?
That would be so much easier.
Everyone and everything has its place in the whole.
And by trying to alter this, we bring the world in disbalance.
I quote:
When people see things as beautiful, ugliness is created.
When people see things as good, evil is created.
Being and non-being produce each other.
Difficult and easy complement each other.
Long and short define each other.
High and low oppose each other.
Fore and aft follow each other.
End quote.
So, how can we put these ideas into practice?
The Taoists suggest several things.
First of all, the Zhuangzi points to the benefits of taking the middle-path.
This means that we shouldn’t stretch ourselves beyond our means, but stay centered, so we conserve our health and stay close to our own nature.
I quote:
“Follow the middle; go by what is constant, and you can stay in one piece, keep yourself alive, look after your parents, and live out your years.”
End quote.
