The Zhuangzi tells us a story about animals and the wind that envy each other for their inborn characteristics.
The centipede envies the snake for the fact that it can move without legs, but the snake envies the wind for its ability to travel great distances without having a body at all.
However, the wind argues that it takes just a finger or foot to hinder it.
All in all, nature has created everything with its own attributes.
Nothing is better than the other; only judgment makes it so.
Thus, we feel the need to change who we are, just to fit an ideal.
White-skinned people try to be tanned, while East-Asians try to look more European, brunettes try to be blondes, and blondes try to be brunettes.
Also, we try to change ourselves because we want to conform to a manmade standard; to fit in, simply because we’re seen as defects when we don’t.
So, a sixth’ finger is cut off, just to comply with the five-finger standard.
Why can’t we just be who we are, the way nature intended us to be?
That would be so much easier.
